I MISSED THE LAST 2 hours on the 2nd day when OOP was introduced so Look in the instructor copy of code for that stuff
.NET framework is like the virtual machine required to run java applications.
	-.Net has 2 main components: Common language runtime(CLR) and Framework class Library (FCL)

CLR
-Execution environment for .NET apps
-memory management and os/language support
-understands managed code and converts to machine code at runtime, like python maybe?

FCL
-.NET framework consists of the CLR and a vast set of libraries (core library and applied libraries)

WinRT vs C#
WinRT is just windows 8-10 specific

A good practice for c# camelcase is function names have first letter capital: FunctionName(), but variable names start with lowercase: variableName
